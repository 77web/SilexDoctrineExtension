===============

This repository regroups a _large_ set of third-party [Silex Extensions](http://silex-project.org/doc/extensions.html).
It can also be used as a skeleton to build new phar Extensions.


Available extensions
--------------------

* [DoctrineExtension](http://readthedocs.org/projects/silex-doctrine-extensions/), a set of services that provide Doctrine2 DBAL and ORM functionalities
* That's all ... for the moment

_huge set, isn't it ?_
